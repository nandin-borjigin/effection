title: Streams and Subscriptions
---

For every tool in the `async/await` toolbox, there is an equilavent in
Effection. We were already introduced to the most important of these in
[the introduction][introduction].

|    Async        |     Effection         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|`Promise`        | `Operation`           |
|`await`          | `yield*`              |
|`async function` | `function*`           |


Likewise, there are also equivalents for the
[Async iteration protocols][async-iteration-protocols].
They are:

|    Async        |     Effection         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|`AsyncIterator`  | `Subscription`        |
|`AsyncIterable`  | `Stream`              |
|`for await`      | `for yield* each`     |


If you're familiar with how to use these constructs, then you will be right at
home working with sequences of data in Effection. In particular, streams are
useful for modeling things like UI events and network connections, and in this
guide we'll see how to create, transform, and consume them.

## Subscription

The Effection equivalent of [`AsyncIterator`][async-iterator] is the
[`Subscription`][subscription]. Like its async counterpart, a
subscription acts like a queue that provides a sequence of values via a
`next()` method. The only difference is that instead of returning a
`Promise` that _fulfills_ to an iterator result, it returns an
[`Operation`][operation] that _yields_ an iterator result.

```ts
function* forEach(subscription) {
  let next = yield* subscription.next();
  while (!next.done) {
    console.log(`value: ${next.value}`);
    next = yield* subscription.next();
  }
  console.log(`done: ${next.value}`);
}
```

Subscriptions, like async iterators, are stateful objects, and calling
the `next()` method on them alters their internal state. Crucially,
taking the next value from the subscription not only retrieves that
value, but also removes it, so that we don't iterate the same value twice.

Just as with async interators, subscriptions are low-level constructs that you
don't interact with all that often, but it is good to know that they are there.
Most of the time however, instead of working with subscriptions directly, you'll
work with streams.

## Stream

Streams are the Effection equivalent of [async iterables][async-iteration-protocols],
and like them, are  _stateless objects_ that does not do anything by
themselves. Whereas a `Subscription` represents hot, active state, a
[`Stream`][stream] on the other hand contains a _recipe_ on how to create
a subscription.

A Stream can have _any number of subscriptions_, each of which receives
the same set of values. Effection ships with [`Channel`][channel], which is
a very handy way to create streams and by proxy, subscriptions. Let's use this
to show the difference between them:

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  // the channel has no subscribers yet!
  yield* port.send('too early');

  let subscription1 = yield* stream;
  let subscription2 = yield* stream;

  yield* port.send('hello');
  yield* port.send('world');

  console.log(yield* subscription1.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "hello" }
  console.log(yield* subscription1.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "world" }
  console.log(yield* subscription2.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "hello" }
  console.log(yield* subscription2.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "world" }
});
```

As you can see, the channel can have multiple subscribers and sending a message
to the channel adds it to each active subscription. If the channel does not
have any active subscriptions, then sending a message to it does nothing.

## Transforming Streams

Because streams are completely stateless, it means that they can be transformed
into other streams using nothing but simple functions. For example, we can apply
several stream transformations in sequence by using the built-in [`map()`][map]
and [`filter()`][filter] functions.

Let's look at an example of this in action by using `map()`:

``` javascript
import { main, map, createChannel } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();
  let textStream = map(value => value.text)(stream);
  let uppercaseStream = map(value => value.toUpperCase())(textStream);

  let subscription = yield* uppercaseStream;

  yield* port.send({ text: 'hello' });
  yield* port.send({ text: 'world' });

  yield* subscription.next();
  //=> { done: false, value: 'HELLO' }

  yield* subscription.next();
  //=> { done: false, value: 'WORLD' }
});
```

If we unpack this a bit, we can see that we're creating a new `Stream` called
`textStream` using the `map` function on `stream`. It derives its values by
pulling the `text` property from each value it sees.

We then use `map` again on `textStream` to create `uppercaseStream`, which
converts each value into uppercase.

When we subscribe to `uppercaseStream` and send a value to the channel, we can
see that all of our transformations are applied.

The `filter()` function can be used to restrict the values emitted by a
stream. The following uses a regular expression to select only those values
that include the string "ello" somewhere inside them.

``` javascript
import { main, filter, createChannel } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();
  let elloStream = filter(value => value.match(/ello/))(stream);

  let subscription = yield* elloStream;

  yield* port.send('hello');

  // our filtered stream skips over this value
  yield* port.send('world');

  yield* port.send('jello');

  console.log(yield* subscription.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: 'hello' }

  console.log(yield* subscription.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: 'jello' }
});
```

When it is run, it prints out "hello" and "jello", but skips "world".

## Piping Streams

But what's up with that weird `map(fn)(stream)` and
`filter(fn)(stream)` syntax anyway? It might have even thrown you for
a loop the first time you saw it. Why don't we just pass the stream
that we want to transform as a second argument, like `map(fn,
stream)`?

The reason is so that we can use `map()`, `filter()` and functions like them to
very rapidly compose into streaming pipelines. For example, we could re-write
the text transformation above using the [`pipe()`][pipe] utility function.


``` javascript
import { main, pipe, map, createChannel } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  let messages = pipe(
    stream,
    map(value => value.text),
    map(value => value.toUpperCase()),
  );

  let subscription = yield* messages;

  yield* port.send({ text: 'hello' });
  yield* port.send({ text: 'world' });

  yield* subscription.next();
  //=> { done: false, value: 'HELLO' }

  yield* subscription.next();
  //=> { done: false, value: 'WORLD' }
});
```

We can do this because invoking `map(fn)` returns a function that
takes a stream as its argument, and returns a stream. This allows us
to chain together any number of these stream-to-stream functions into
a pipeline to create new streams that apply each transformation in
sequence.

>ðŸ’¡The `pipe()` function that comes with Effection is just a utility for
> function composition that is provided for convenience. You can just as

In fact, any function that takes a stream and returns a stream can be used in
such a way, not just `map()`, and `filter()`. This means you can write your own
stream combinators, just so long as they return a function that takes a stream
and returns as stream.

## for yield* each

The entire point of having a stream is to consume values from it, and we
have already seen how we can use `yield*` to subscribe to a Stream and turn
a Stream into a Subscription. But there is an easier way!

When working with an async iterator, you would not normally traverse it by
manually invoking the `next()` method repeatedly. Instead, you would use the
[`for await of`][asynchronous iterators] syntax to conveniently focus on the
work to be done with each item instead of the mechanics of iteration.
It is the same with Effection streams.

The simplest way to consume a stream in Effection is with the `for
yield* each` loop. It is almost identical to the `for await` loop from
`async/await`. The biggest difference is that you _must_ yield to the
`each.next` operation as the last step of your loop.

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel, each, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('world');
  });

  for (let value of yield* each(stream)) {
    console.log('got value:', value);
    yield* each.next;
  }
```

Why do we need to use `spawn()` here? We know that sending values to a
stream does nothing unless someone is subscribed to the stream, so we
cannot send any values before we begin our loop, but we also cannot
send any values *after* we begin our loop because the loop will never
complete until the stream closes (more about that later). So we need
to run both the loop _and_ the sending of values concurrently, and as
we've already learned, when we need to do multiple things
concurrently, that's when we use `spawn()`.

We could also flip this example around like this:

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel, next, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    for (let value of yield* each(stream)) {
      console.log('got value:', value);
      yield* each.next;
    }
  });

  yield* sleep(1000);
  yield* port.send('hello');
  yield* sleep(1000);
  yield* port.send('world');
});
```

Another way of consuming values from a stream is to use the `first`. This is
handy if you want to just the very next item from a stream of events.

``` javascript
import { main, first, createChannel, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('world');
  });

  let value = yield* first(stream);
  console.log(value); // logs 'hello'

});
```

As you can see here, once we send any value to the Stream, `first()`
returns that value. Now you might be tempted to call `first()`
multiple times, like this:

``` javascript
// THIS IS NOT IDEAL
import { main, createChannel, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('world');
  });

  let firstValue = yield* first(stream);
  console.log(firstValue); // logs 'hello'

  let secondValue = yield* first(stream);
  console.log(secondValue); // logs 'world'
});
```

And while this works, it has a problem that becomes apparent if we slightly
change the order we do things in:

``` javascript
// THIS IS NOT IDEAL
import { main, createChannel, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* port.send('world');
  });

  let firstValue = yield* first(stream);
  console.log(firstValue); // logs 'hello'

  yield* sleep(1000);

  // will block forever! We missed the message!
  let secondValue = yield* first(stream);

  // we never get here!
  console.log(secondValue);
});
```

This makes it very clear why Subscriptions are necessary. It is
because unlike listening for one-off events, a subscription guarantees
that we can never miss any messages. Here we can see how Subscriptions
are more resilient:

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  let subscription = yield* stream;

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* port.send('world');
  });

  let { value: firstValue } = yield* subscription.next();
  console.log(firstValue); // logs 'hello'

  yield* sleep(1000);

  let { value: secondValue } = yield subscription.next();
  console.log(secondValue); // logs 'world'
});
```

## Closing streams

All good things must come to an end, including a stream of data. In these cases
Effection streams and subscriptions optionally support passing a final piece of
data when there are no more values to be received.  Usually, if present, this
piece of data represents a summary of the stream and something about its final
end state. For example, when a websocket is closed it emits a
[`close` event][close-event] that contains a numeric code and a description of
why the socked was closed.

The value of this last piece of data is the value of the iterator result when
the `done` attribute is true. Unsprisingly, this mirrors the behavior of an
async iterator exactly.

```js
import { main, sleep, spawn, createChannel } from "effection";

await main(function*() {
  let { port, stream } = createChannel();

  let subscription = yield* stream;

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* port.send('hello');
    yield* port.close({ words: 2 });
  });

  let next = yield* subscription.next();

  while (!next.done) {
    console.log(next.value);
    next = yield* subscription.next();
  }

  console.log(`${next.value} words total`);
});

//=> hello
//=> world
//=> 2 words total
```

Just like with an async iterator, if you want to access the very last iterator
result, you cannot use the `for...of`. You _must_ use a `while-loop`. This is
because the body of the loop only executes for iterator result where the `done`
property is `false`. It does _not_ execute for the last iterator result where
`done` is true.
